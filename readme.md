#Mobile-first Frontend for Arduino 16x16 LED panel controlled via Bluetooth

LED Canvas is an interactive pixel art controlled display. This repository is the mobile first frontend application designed to send
signal to the bluetooth enabled Arduino controlled LED panel. 

##Project vision
The project itself is made to be visualy appealing and more of an art piece. There are many features the main one being the ability
to draw on the panel and save pixel art. The project has been a remarkable achievment, representing a profound learning experience. I feel
that this project is a great demonstration of my technical abilities and creative ideas.
