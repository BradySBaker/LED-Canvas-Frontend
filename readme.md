# Frontend for Arduino 16x16 LED panel controlled via Bluetooth

LED Canvas is an interactive pixel art device. This repository is the mobile-first frontend application designed to send signal to the bluetooth enabled Arduino controlled LED panel. 

## Project vision
The project itself is made to be visualy appealing and more of an art piece. There are many features the main one being the ability to draw on the panel in real-time and save pixel art. The project has been a remarkable achievment, representing a profound learning experience. I feel that this project is a great demonstration of my technical abilities and creative ideas. Throughout this endeavor i've encountered many challenges and it has greatly improve my problem-solving skills. I have plans to continue this project in the future and possibly create a consumer available product.
